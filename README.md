An optimized theme for web development that comes with two versions: light & dark.

## Presentation

Coldark is a gray-blue theme. The colors used respect the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in order to provide sufficient reading comfort. However, with opacity, it is possible that some contrasts are diminished and that they are above level AA.

## Platforms

Coldark is available for:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=armandphilippot.coldark) (repo: [Coldark - VS Code](https://github.com/ArmandPhilippot/coldark-vscode/))
